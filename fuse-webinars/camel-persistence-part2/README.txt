DESCRIPTION
===========

This is the material accompanying the presentation of part I - Database persistence with Camel from simple to more elaborated.
It covers the different demo made during the talk and is organised like that :

database = project containing the scripts to create the database in HSQLDB and the jar of the HSQLDB server
jdbc = maven project for camel-jdbc demo
sql = idem but for camel-sql component
jpa = mavemn project containing camel routes for JPA persistence
sql-spring-persistence = maven projetc with additional examples (not coivered during the webinars) but could be used to test transaction with SQL component


DATABASE
========

STEP 1 : Open a DOS/UNIX console in the folder persistence/database

STEP 2 : Start the HSQLDB Server using the command

java -cp lib/hsqldb-1.8.0.10.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:reportdb -dbname.0 reportdb

STEP 3 : In a separate DOS/UNIX console, start the Swing DataBase Manager console using the following command

java -cp lib/hsqldb-1.8.0.10.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing --user sa --url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/reportdb

STEP 4 : Create Schema and Tables using the script located in the file persistence/database/src/config/hsqldb/reportdb-scripts.sql

Execute the scripts 1), 2) and 3) defined in this file

MAVEN
=====

Except the database directory containing, the other folders are maven projects. The webinar
part1 can be build using the command : mvn clean install in the persistence folder.

To launch each project individually, simply execute the following command in a DOS/UNIX console

mvn camel:run

Depending in whichproject you are (jdbc, sql or jpa), you will have to copy files
to allow the file:// endpoint of the camel routes to read the corresponding file (key.txt, keys.txt or csv.txtx) and insert data
into the database
